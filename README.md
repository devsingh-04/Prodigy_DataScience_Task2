Titanic Dataset Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. 
The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key patterns and trends in the data.
The goal is to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic.

Dataset

The Titanic dataset includes information about the
passengers, such as their age,
sex,
class, 
and whether they survived the disaster. 
The dataset can be found on Kaggle's Titanic competition page.

FEATURES

DATA CLEANING:
Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and ensuring the data is in the correct format.

EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS:
Generating summary statistics, visualizing distributions, and exploring relationships between variables.

VISUALISATION:
Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative plots that reveal insights into the data.

Data Cleaning Steps

Handling Missing Values:


Filled missing Age values with the median age.
Filled missing Embarked values with the most common port.
Dropped the Cabin column due to a high number of missing values.

Verification:

Ensured there are no more missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary Statistics:


Displayed basic statistics for numerical columns.
Distribution Analysis:

Plotted the distribution of Age.

Analyzed the distribution of categorical variables such as Survived and Pclass.
Relationship Analysis:

Examined survival rates by Pclass, Sex, and AgeGroup.
